# [Managing Packages with NPM](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis#managing-packages-with-npm)
- *npm (Node Package Manager)* is command line tool to install, create and share packages of JavaScript code written for Node.js


## How to Use package.json, the Core of Any Node.js Project and npm Package
- The `package.json` file is the center of any Node.js project or npm package. It stores information about our project.
- The `package.json` consists of a singe *JSON* object with two required fields *name* and *version*. it's good practice to provide additional information that could be useful to future users and maintainers.


## Add a Description to your package.json
- `description` should be short and informative.
- `description` is a great way to summarize what this project does and help other developers, future maintainers and myself understand project quickly.
- When the project publishes to npm, `description` is the string that show off the idea behind this project.


## Add Keywords to Your package.json
- The `keywords` field is where we describe our project using related keywords


## Add a License to Your package.json
- The `license` filed is where we inform users of what they are allowed to do with our project.


## Add a Version to Your package.json
- A `version` is one of the required fields of your project. This fields describes the current version of the project.


## Expand Your Project with External Packages from npm
- One of the biggest reasons to use a package manager is their powerful dependency management.
- Instead of manually having to make sure that we get all dependencies whenever we set up a project on a new computer, *npm* automatically installs everything for you.
- `dependencies` section in `packages.json` help *npm* know exactly what packages that our project need?
```json
"dependencies": {
	"package-name": "version",
	"express": "4.14.0"
}
```


## Manage npm Dependencies By Understanding Semantic Versioning
- Libraries, frameworks or other tools published on *npm* should use *Sematic Versioning* in order to clearly communicate what kind of changes projects can expect if they update.
```json
"package": "MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH"
```
- The MAJOR version should increment when you make incompatible API changes. The MINOR version should increment when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner. The PATCH version should increment when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes. This means that PATCHes are bug fixes and MINORs add new features but neither of them break what worked before. Finally, MAJORs add changes that wonâ€™t work with earlier versions.


## Use the Tilde-Character to Always Use the Latest Patch Version of a Dependency
- Including a specific version of a package is a useful way to freeze our dependencies if we need to make sure that our project still stay compatible.
- But, is most use cases, we don't want to miss bug fixes that hopefully don't break our projects.
- To allow *npm* dependency to update to the latest PATH version, we use tilde character `~` before the version.
```json
"package": "~1.3.8"
```
- *npm* can install the version of 1.3.x


## Use the Caret-Character to Use the Latest Minor Version of a Dependency
- To allow *npm* dependency to update the the latest MINOR version, we use caret character `^` before the version
```json
"package": "^1.3.8"
```
- *npm* can install the version of 1.x.x


# Remove a Package from Your Dependencies
- To remove a external package that we no longer need, just remove the corresponding key-value pair of that package from our dependencies.
